PrawnCharts generates line graphs in Prawn.  There are no other
dependencies other than Prawn, so this library is perfect for generating
vector images with small file sizes.

Todo:
1. Review how everything is collected and see if code can be reorganized

2. Make functions extend from Prawn, so you can write pdf.draw_chart,
etc.
3. Review has everything is connected and see if any code can be reused
or simplified.
4. What inputs are mandatory and what are optional?
